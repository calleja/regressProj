implement stepwise regression:
- done manually
- use functions: step(, direction="backward, forward, both")
- throw all variables into a model and plot residuals, etc: plot(fit)... "fit" = model object

Check the applicability of the model:
- independence of errors... use autocorrelation plots
- homoskedasticity (constant variance) - check on residuals vs. predicted plot
- normality of errors: look at normal probability plot

Test coefficients:
- hypothesis testing whether each coefficient is significantly different from 0

Applying ANOVA:
requirements: data within each group is nearly normal; variability across the groups is ~ equal
- the null hypothesis is the means across all groups are equal

## project instructions  ###
You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

    “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
    "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"
####        ######

Marks on the project:
1) Did you interpret the coefficients correctly?
2) Did you do some exploratory data analysis
3) Did you fit multiple models and detail your strategy for model selection
4) Did you answer the questions of interest or detail why the question is not answerable
5) DId you do a residual plot and some diagnostics
6) Did you quantify the uncertainty in your conclusions and/or perform an inference correctly
7) Did you communicate your findings


Personal Considerations:
1) Do I need to center or scale the variables? How do I do so in multiple regression?
